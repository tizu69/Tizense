# Tizense, the Tizu License

While originally meant as a joke, Tizense is a small collection of licenses with slightly different use cases. Due to this, Tizenses are only called Tizense, TizenseB, TizenseC and so on. Not very helpful, is it? Below is a list of all Tizenses and their intended purpose.

When using any Tizense in your projects, please do so in a file located in the root directory of your repo that is called "LICENSE" or "LICENSE.txt".

Do you think Tizense is a nice license, but think something is missing for a specific use case? Feel free to modify the original [Tizense](tz/a.txt) and create a PR.
Unless your version of Tizense just doesn't feel right (we'll explain why not when rejecting, btw ^^), you got a good chance that you create the next Tizense!
